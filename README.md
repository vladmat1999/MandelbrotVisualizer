# MandelbrotVisualizer
A Java FX Mandelbrot Set visualizer

This app is still in development and currently allows only limited resolution (due to Java's double limit) and pretty big rendering times. I wil be working on a BigDecimal version with more options (such as choosing the color scheme). This was a fun little project I did to improve my Java skills. Feel free to modify it and contribute as you like (improvements are apreciated).
